# UFOs

### Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to provide an in-depth look at recorded UFO sightings. Through the use of JavaScript as our primary means to compile and showcase our data, we have created a working website that is able to filter through several different criteria for users to search for UFO sightings with greater specificity. Along with the use of CSS customization options, we have created a customized and engaging website for users.

### Results

At a glance, our webpage is simple with a section for interactivity with visitors of the website. The "Filter Search" allows users to filter the data on the site to return specific UFO sightings based on user input filters/criteria, filters such as Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

#### Site Walkthrough Example:

*In the image above, the 'Filter Search' area of the site takes five criteria: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape*

*Here, if we enter "ca" (California) in the State filter box, it will return only and all data of UFO sightings in the state of California.

*Furthermore, we can apply multiple filters at once. Here, the state "ca" is combined with the shape "triangle" returning all UFO sightings that are of a triangle shape in the state of California*


### Summary

One drawback of the current design of this website and its Filter Search function is the lack of a "Duration"
criteria. In our dataset, the duration of the UFO sightings are present and this would be a great addition for
those searching for shorter or longer durations of UFO sightings given the content. A recommendation for
this website and code based on the drawback would be the addition of the "Duration" search criteria. Given
that our code is already set with all the existing criteria, this would be an easy addition. Another
recommendation for further development would be further customization of the layout with additional colors
and images. If we were to receive future and updated data that may include photographs, we would want a
section that would display those images alongside our current text data.
