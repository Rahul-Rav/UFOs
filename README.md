# UFOs

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an in-depth look at recorded UFO sightings. Through the use of JavaScript as our primary means to compile and showcase our data, we have created a working website that is able to filter through several different criteria for users to search UFO sightings with greater specificity; Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. Along with the use of CSS customization, we have created a customized and engaging website for users.

### Results
At a glance, our webpage is simple with a section for interactivity with visitors of the website. The "Filter Search" allows user to filter the data on the site to return specific UFO sightings based on user input filters. Filters such as Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

#### Example: Filtering by Shape

### Summary
One drawback of the current design of this website and its Filter Search function is the lack of a "Duration" criteria. In our dataset, the duration of the UFO sightings are present and this would be a great addition for those searching for shorter or longer durations of UFO sightings given the content. A recommendation for this website and code based on the drawback would be the addition of the "Duration" search criteria. Given that our code is already set with all the existing criteria, this would be an easy addition. Another recommendation for further development would be further customization of the layout with additional colors and images. If we were to receive future and updated data that may include photographs, we would want a section that would display those images alongside our current text data.
